## Soft Skills
I am a communicative, empathy, patient, punctual, easy-going, open-minded, adaptive, creative, and responsible person. <br/>
I could be a proper team player who is able to take independent decisions. Self-development is a priority of my life values, <br/>
so I always prefer to deepen my gained knowledge and to improve & perfect myself.  I’m quite a self-critical person. <br/>
Mostly I am not afraid to admit my mistakes, always would try to analyze and fix them, correct everything and do my best next time.
